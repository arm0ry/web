                Bonding curves are autonomous markets. Its programmability enables communities to transact for local products and serivces, and also segment portions of transaction for infinite potential. They ensure token liquidity, facilitate price discovery, and increase asset efficiency.

Most trail posts today have QR codes on them already, we can repurpose them for hikers to submit onchain check-ins and report trail conditions. Kind of like Waze for trails! In addition to being the medium for fundraising, this NFT can also help locals identify traffic on trails, assess maintainenance schedule, and potentially help locate hikers when they get lost. Best of all, this is cheap to do!"}
